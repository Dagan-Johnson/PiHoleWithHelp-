Hello And Welcome to my Walk-through for the PiHole project! Now I am sure you're wondering what the point of this is,
as there are already a large amount of documentation online for this project. Well I recently completed this project
(sort of) and wanted to try and save anyone some time with some troubleshooting that I had to do so if you see something
EXCLAIMED please pay special attention.

1. BEFORE HAND(IMPORTANT)
  A.Pre-checks before starting
    So for this project I really(x3) recomend you check your ISP availability to change your dhcp/dns settings. I did not
    check this and made it to the very last step only to learn that XFinity does not allow for you to change this information
    on your own. Thus negating all 8ish hours of project time and troubleshooting i did.
  
    Next thing to check is whether or not your pi has wifi capabilities. You can do this by checking the product info, but 
    honestly I was useing a w1.1 which i understand is one of the oldest models and it did have capabilites so likely your
    all good. Also it's a good idea to have at least a monitor so that if you get a lil out of sorts you can see what the pi
    is complaining about.
  
  B.What you need physically
    So as i understand it, raspberry pi's need to be flashed usually utilizing an sd card. They flash on first reset after
    inserting the card, but i'll talk on that later. So you need something to be able to read/write to an sd card. If you're
    looking for exactly the one i used the link is below. 
      
    https://www.amazon.com/Aluminum-Adapter-Computer-Devices-Compatible/dp/B0FJB84N94/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?c=ts&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.H5IKRjDRVYaCKNz_1AX2LcKn9hiLBC6LkUgo1WVJ6HgxeT_lZMG-M1rGpWvet9rHqAd4qhTFQIB8v87EHNrJbb4e-vYDNnJGQNJTbEWMckOPu0s0x1gvhLcdaOw6-0vxNapqZK4UaxwFSHy29mcfGkETtpNc66CZqVGxANNeWWvQcOX4o5TJIqjU1G_eMdUFN_S2cd0bLG4G-v3qgJXqETW1G9F-vQ-KkHsyY-5QoxyUBSYe_BPyfnWMhsT3huF5QeHANJlONw6o8rz1CpcUYePLfZO0JEokhrKLLd3pGMk.g8gNiZMrono_k8BJ9rv2tQ8r6bnCxobXMn-zTUfd4Q0&dib_tag=se&keywords=Computer+Memory+Card+Adapters&qid=1761934191&s=pc&sr=1-1-spons&ts_id=15874201&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&psc=1

    You'll also need a device that's able to connect to the internet to be able to download a few helpful installers. Below is the
    itemized list.
      1. SD card adapter
      2. Device able to connect to internet and previous adapter
      3. Monitor and connection for that monitor (optional, but do it man frfr)
  
2.Getting into it
  A. First thing you need is the raspberry pi imager for the flash. This also takes some time to flash and verify so get on this
     ASAP. 
      
      https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/

      So once you have the imager downloaded, you should have your sd card inserted into your computer of choice, and running
      said imager. The program should be asking you what type of os you would like to use. I used the raspberry pi lite headless
      as it is not too resources intensive and the more local mem you can give the pi the better. Seems like the lite is a less
      used model so you can find it under the more section for the os. After you input the beginning stuf and click next you
      should get a prompt that asks if you would like to implement some settings or just do the bare install.

      YOU SAY YES! edit those settings so we don't have to add files yourself. but if you don't want to ill explain how to do that too


      IMPORTANT! If you input the wrong settings before flashing you'll have to re-flash, so it's worth it to slow down and make
                sure you have everything right the first time.
          
        a. If you said yes these are the things you need to change
          1.SSH on
          2.WIFI credentials
            Make sure the password and ssid is correct as it is case sensitive and if you mess up
            on this part after flashing 
            -if your ssid is hidden there should be an option to indicate this.
          3.Login Credentials
            -Put in a username you'll remmber and a basic password. This is for the ssh section where we'll be connecting to the 
              pi over the network to ensure its working all good. 
          4.Pi name change(optional)
            - feel free if you like, it'll come into play for the ssh section and also on your network list.

        b. If you're a stickler for not using software you need to make two files. The NAMES of these files are real important for 
            the flashing so here's a description of 'em and you should be able to pull both from this repository. THey need to be
            under the "boot" file set. That is to say when you put the card back in the reader after flashing you should see a 
            
          1.SSH
            -completly empty and you should see it dissapear after flashing, this is just telling the board to turn on ssh
              capabilities.
          2. wpa_supplicant.conf
            -You'll need to replace the ssid with your wifi network name as well as the psk with the password/passkey. These are 
             case sensitive.
            -If you're outside the US that will also need to be changed. 
          
        c. If it didn't work my suggestion would be to first connect your pi to a monitor and see if it's telling you anything.
           If nothing is out of the ordinary it should be displaying a ip address. If that address is 127.whatever.whatever that 
           means it did not connect correctly to the network(it should say 10.whatever.whatever.whatever). Unfortunatly you will have to restart and re-flash. If you tried the 
           method of using the launcher to set the settings I would double check you input all the info correct and try again with 
           it aleast as single more time before attempting to make the files yourself. If you tried with the files the first time 
           check out the launher settings.

  B. Alright so if this all worked out you should be able to see your pi on the network. You should be able to confirm this by 
     checking your routers info. 
        
          a.You can do this by going to http://10.0.0.1. there you should be able to login with admin and 
            password in the username and password fields respectively.

          b.Navigate to your connected devices or network connections list. You should see your raspberry pi there under your chosen 
            name.
                -small note some raspberry pi's can only connect to 2.4gHz networks so double check you have capabilities to conenct to.
          
          c.You should be able to see it's given ip address. Open a cmd window on your pc and go ahead and type ping "theRaspberryPi'sIP"
            but with out the quotations.
